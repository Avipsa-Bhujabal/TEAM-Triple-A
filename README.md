## About Project

We’ve chosen a project where we create a virtual assistant using python language. 
Virtual assistants have been a lot of help in the present world and we aim to create one close to the infamous siri and alexa. 
These assistants are basically born from Artificial Intelligence and are meant to help us make our day to day lives easy.
We can get tons of activities done remotely using voice i.e within a certain distance range and other activities such as planning using these while we’re busy 
and struggling to memorise everything around us. It would help to make notes, set reminders of works that we tend to forget in our busy lives.
